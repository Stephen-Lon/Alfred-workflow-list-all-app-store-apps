# Alfred-workflow-list-all-app-store-apps
List all apps downloaded from the Mac App Store

# Introduction

This workflow simply lists all apps that you have downloaded from the Mac App Store. It is useful if you need to find and delete apps which you no longer use and may have forgotten.

# Usage

Type the keyword (the default is `las`) and the list will be displayed in alphabetical order. You will then have the option of ending the workflow (the default—just press ⏎) or copying the list to the clipboard.
